## Introduction 

*Scattered Light Imaging (SLI)* is a novel neuroimaging technique that allows to explore the substructure of nerve fibers, especially in regions with crossing nerve fibers, in whole brain sections with micrometer resolution ([Menzel et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01037)). By illuminating histological brain sections from different angles and measuring the transmitted light under normal incidence, characteristic light intensity profiles (SLI profiles) can be obtained which provide crucial information such as the directions of crossing nerve fibers in each measured image pixel. 

This repository contains the *Scattered Light Imaging ToolboX (SLIX)* &ndash; an open-source Python package that allows a fully automated evaluation of SLI measurements and the generation of different parameter maps. The purpose of SLIX is twofold: First, it allows to transform the raw data of SLI measurements (SLI image stack) to human-readable parameter maps that can be used for further analysis and interpreted by researchers. To this end, SLIX also contains functions to visualize the resulting parameter maps, e.g. as colored vector maps. Second, the results of SLIX can be processed further for use in tractography algorithms. For example, the resulting fiber direction maps can be stored as angles or as unit vectors, which can be used as input for streamline tractography algorithms ([Nolden et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-25326-4_17)).

The figure belows shows the different steps, from the SLI measurement to the generation of parameter maps: 

<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/figure_Doku.jpg" height="327">

### SLI Measurement
The sample is illuminated from different angles, with constant polar angle <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta"> and different equidistant azimuthal angles <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\phi"> (starting on top and rotating clock-wise), see figure (a). A camera behind the sample records an image of the transmitted light under normal incidence for each direction of illumination, yielding a series of images (b). 

The **SLI image stack** is used as input for *SLIX* (.nii or .tiff are accepted). The software assumes that the measurement has been performed with equidistant angles over a full range of 360°. The number of images defines the illumination angles (e.g. when using 24 images as input, the software assumes that the images were recorded with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\phi"> = 0°,15°,...,345°).

### SLI Profiles
Each pixel in the SLI image stack contains a light intensity profile (**SLI profile** <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I(\phi)">), which is characteristic for the brain tissue structure at this point (see [Menzel et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01037) for more details). With *SLIX*, it is possible to automatically extract and evaluate the SLI profiles for all image pixels. 

The **peak positions** are computed with [scipy.signal.find_peaks](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html), taking the 360° periodicity of the signal into account. To account for inaccuracies introduced by the discretization of the SLI profile, the determined peak positions are corrected by calculating the geometric center of the peak tips with a height corresponding to 6% of the total signal amplitude. The value of 6% turned out to be the best choice to obtain reliable fiber orientations (see [Menzel et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01037), Appx. B), but can be changed by the user. Figure (c) shows an SLI profile with 15° discretization and the corrected peak positions as vertical lines.

To avoid that peaks caused by noise or details in the fiber structure impair the computed fiber direction angles, only *prominent* peaks are used for further evaluation. The **peak prominence** ([scipy.signal.peak_prominences](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.peak_prominences.html#scipy.signal.peak_prominences)) indicates how strongly a peak stands out from the background signal and is defined by the vertical distance between the top of the peak and the higher of the two neighboring minima (see figure (c), in red). If not defined otherwise by the user, peaks with a prominence above 8% of the total signal amplitude (max-min) are considered as prominent peaks. The value of 8% turned out to be the optimal choice for the generation of reliable fiber orientations (best compromise between correctly and wrongly detected peaks for regions with known fiber orientations, see [Menzel et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01037), Appx. A). 

The **peak width** (see figure (c), in dark blue) is determined as the full width of the peak at a height corresponding to the peak height minus half of the peak prominence. 

The in-plane **fiber direction angles** <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\varphi"> are computed from the (corrected) mid positions of prominent peak pairs with a pair-wise distance of (180 +/- 35)°, see figure (c) in green/magenta. The range of possible distances has been limited to ensure that the out-of-plane angles of the nerve fibers are not too large (the direction angles of inclined crossing fibers cannot be reliably determined).

### Parameter Maps
By evaluating the SLI profiles of each image pixel, *SLIX* generates different parameter maps, which provide various information about the investigated brain tissue: 
- The [average map](#average) shows the overall scattering of the tissue; [maximum](#maximum) and [minimum](#minimum) can be used to get an idea of the signal amplitude and the signal-to-noise ratio.
- The [number of non-prominent peaks](#low-prominence-peaks) and the [number of prominent peaks](#high-prominence-peaks) indicate the clarity of the signal (regions with indefinite scattering signals, such as background or regions with a small number of nerve fibers, show a higher number of non-prominent peaks); the [average peak prominence](#average-peak-prominence) indicates the reliability of the peak positions.
- The [average peak width](#average-peak-width) and the [peak distance](#peak-distance) correlate with the out-of-plane angle of the nerve fibers (in-plane fibers show two narrow peaks with a large distance of about 180°).
- The [direction maps](#direction-angles) show the in-plane direction angles of the nerve fibers for up to three different crossing fibers. The fiber directions can be represented by a colored vector map, as described in the [tutorial](#tutorial) below.

With [`SLIXLineplotParameterGenerator`](#evaluation-of-sli-profiles), it is possible to evaluate individual SLI profiles and compute characteristics such as the number of peaks, their positions, and in-plane fiber direction angles. For a given SLI image stack, [`SLIXParameterGenerator`](#generation-of-parameter-maps) computes the desired parameter maps for all image pixels.

## Installation of SLIX

Note: The current version of SLIX can only be executed under macOS or Linux as operating system because of dependencies. If you want to use SLIX under Windows, please use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://ubuntu.com/wsl). Support for Windows is planned for the future.

git clone git@github.com:3d-pli/SLIX.git
cd SLIX

# A virtual environment is recommended:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

##### How to install SLIX as Python package
```
# Install via PyPi
pip install SLIX

# Install after cloning locally
git clone git@github.com:3d-pli/SLIX.git
cd SLIX
pip install .
```

## Evaluation of SLI Profiles

`SLIXLineplotParameterGenerator` allows the evaluation of individual SLI profiles (txt-files with a list of intensity values): For each SLI profile, the maximum, minimum, number of prominent peaks, corrected peak positions, fiber direction angles, and average peak prominence are computed and stored in a text file. The user has the option to generate a plot of the SLI profile that shows the profile together with the peak positions before/after correction. The corrected peak positions are determined by calculating the geometric center of the peak tip, improving the accuracy of the determined peak positions in discretized SLI profiles. If not defined otherwise, the peak tip height corresponds to 6% of the total signal amplitude (for derivation, see [Menzel et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01037), Appx. B).

```
SLIXLineplotParameterGenerator -i [INPUT-TXT-FILES] -o [OUTPUT-FOLDER] [[parameters]]

### Required Arguments
| Argument      | Function                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i, --input`  | Input text files, describing the SLI profiles (list of intensity values). |
| `-o, --output` | Output folder used to store the characteristics of the SLI profiles in a txt-file (Max, Min, Num_Peaks, Peak_Pos, Directions, Prominence). Will be created if not existing. |

### Optional Arguments
| Argument      | Function                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--smoothing`  | Smoothing of SLI profiles before evaluation. The smoothing is performed using a Savitzky-Golay filter with 45 sampling points and a second order polynomial. (Designed for measurements with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta\phi"> < 5° steps to reduce the impact of irrelevant details in the fiber structure, cf. orange vs. black curve in Figure 1c in the [paper](https://github.com/3d-pli/SLIX/blob/master/paper/paper.pdf).) |
| `--with_plots` | Generates plots (png-files) showing the SLI profiles and the determined peak positions (orange dots: before correction; green crosses: after correction). |
| `--target_peak_height` | Change peak tip height used for correcting the peak positions. (Default: 6% of total signal amplitude). Only recommended for experienced users! |

### Example
The following example demonstrates the evaluation of two SLI profiles, which can be found in the "examples" folder of the SLIX repository:
```
SLIXLineplotParameterGenerator -i examples/*.txt -o output --with_plots
```
The resulting plot and txt-file are shown below, exemplary for one of the SLI profiles (90-Stack-1647-1234.txt):

<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/90-Stack-1647-1234.png" height="327">


```
Max: 119.0
Min: 68.0
Num_Peaks: 4
Peak_Pos: [2.5935516 7.723009 14.294096 20.10292]
Directions: [143.3426513671875 61.305511474609375 -1.0]
Prominence: 0.27323946356773376
```
The plot shows the SLI profile derived from a stack of 24 images. The x-axis displays the number of images, the y-axis the measured light intensity [a.u.]. To detect peaks at the outer boundaries, the profile was extended taking the 360° periodicity of the signal into account; the red line indicates the boundary. The orange dots are the original peak positions, the green crosses indicate the corrected peak positions, taking the discretization of the profile into account.

The txt-file lists the maximum and minimum intensity values in the SLI profile, the number of prominent peaks (i.e. peaks with a prominence above 8% of the total signal amplitude), the corrected peak positions (on the x-axis), the direction angles of the nerve fibers (in degrees, derived from the mid-positions between peak pairs), and the average prominence of the peaks normalized by the average of the signal.

## Generation of Parameter Maps

`SLIXParameterGenerator` allows the generation of different parameter maps from an SLI image stack.

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-r, --roisize`    | Average every NxN pixels in the SLI image stack and run the evaluation on the resulting (downsampled) images. Later on, the images will be upscaled to match the input file dimensions. (Default: N=1, i.e.`-r 1`) |
| `--with_mask`      | Consider all image pixels with low scattering as background: Pixels for which the maximum intensity value of the SLI profile is below a defined threshold (`--mask_threshold`) are set to zero and will not be further evaluated.                                                                |
| `--mask_threshold` | Set the threshold for the background mask (can only be used together with `--with_mask`). Higher values might remove the background better but will also include more regions with gray matter. (Default = 10) |
| `--num_procs`      | Run the program with the selected number of processes. (Default = either 16 threads or the maximum number of threads available.)                                  |
| `--with_smoothing` | Apply smoothing to the SLI profiles for each image pixel before evaluation. The smoothing is performed using a Savitzky-Golay filter with 45 sampling points and a second order polynomial. (Designed for measurements with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta\phi"> < 5° steps to reduce the impact of irrelevant details in the fiber structure, cf. orange vs. black curve in Figure 1c in the [paper](https://github.com/3d-pli/SLIX/blob/master/paper/paper.pdf).)                                                                                     |
| `--prominence_threshold` | Change the threshold for prominent peaks. Peaks with lower prominences will not be used for further evaluation. (Default: 8% of total signal amplitude.) Only recommended for experienced users!

The arguments listed below determine which parameter maps will be generated from the SLI image stack.  If any such argument (except `–-optional`) is used, no parameter map besides the ones specified will be generated. If none of these arguments is used, all parameter maps except the optional ones will be generated: peakprominence, number of (prominent) peaks, peakwidth, peakdistance, direction angles in crossing regions.

| Argument       | Function                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `--peaks`         | Generate two parameter maps (`_low_prominence_peaks.tiff` and `_high_prominence_peaks.tiff`) containing the number of peaks in an SLI profile (image pixel) with a prominence below and above the defined prominence_threshold (Default: 8% of the total signal amplitude). |
| `--peakwidth`     | Generate a parameter map (`_peakwidth.tiff`) containing the average peak width (in degrees) of all prominent peaks in an SLI profile. |
| `--peakdistance`  | Generate a parameter map (`_peakdistance.tiff`) containing the distance between two prominent peaks (in degrees) in an SLI profile. Pixels for which the SLI profile shows more/less than two prominent peaks are set to `-1`. |
| `--direction`     | Generate three parameter maps (`_dir_1.tiff`, `_dir_2.tiff`, `_dir_3.tiff`) indicating up to three in-plane direction angles of (crossing) fibers (in degrees). If any or all direction angles cannot be determined for an image pixel, this pixel is set to `-1` in the respective map.|
| `--optional`      | Generate four additional parameter maps: average value of each SLI profile (`_avg.tiff`), maximum value of each SLI profile (`_max.tiff`), minimum value of each SLI profile (`_min.tiff`), and in-plane direction angles (in degrees) in regions without crossings (`_dir.tiff`). Image pixels for which the SLI profile shows more than two prominent peaks are set to `-1` in the direction map. |

### Example
The following example demonstrates the generation of the parameter maps, for two artificially crossing sections of human optic tracts (left) and the upper left corner of a coronal vervet brain section (right):

#### How to run the demo yourself:

##### 1. Download the needed files:

Command line:
```
wget https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_227176556f3c4bb38df9feea4b91200c/hbp-d000048_ScatteredLightImaging_pub/Human_Brain/optic_tracts_crossing_sections/SLI-human-Sub-01_2xOpticTracts_s0037_30um_SLI_105_Stack_3days_registered.nii

```

[Vervet1818_s0512_60um_SLI_090_Stack_1day.nii](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_227176556f3c4bb38df9feea4b91200c/hbp-d000048_ScatteredLightImaging_pub/Vervet_Brain/coronal_sections/Vervet1818_s0512_60um_SLI_090_Stack_1day.nii)

##### 2. Run SLIX:
```
SLIXParameterGenerator -i ./SLI-human-Sub-01_2xOpticTracts_s0037_30um_SLI_105_Stack_3days_registered.nii -o . --num_procs 4 --roisize 5

SLIXParameterGenerator -i ./Vervet1818_s0512_60um_SLI_090_Stack_1day.nii -o . --roisize 10 --direction
```

The execution of both commands should take around one minute max. The resulting parameter maps will be downsampled. To obtain full resolution parameter maps, do not use the `roisize` option. In this case, the computing time will be higher (around 25 times higher for the first example and 100 times higher for the second example). 

To display the resulting parameter maps, you can use e.g. [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Download) or [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads). More examples (SLI image stacks and resulting parameter maps) can be found on the [EBRAINS data repository](https://kg.ebrains.eu/search/instances/Dataset/de08dcb8-28d4-4f8f-b019-ef0f8924d5d4).

### Resulting Parameter Maps

All 12 parameter maps that can be generated with *SLIX* are shown below, exemplary for the coronal vervet brain section used in the above demo (available [here](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_227176556f3c4bb38df9feea4b91200c/hbp-d000048_ScatteredLightImaging_pub/Vervet_Brain/coronal_sections/Vervet1818_s0512_60um_SLI_090_Stack_1day.nii)). In contrast to the above demo, the parameter maps were generated with full resolution. For testing purposes, we suggest to run the evaluation on downsampled images, e.g. with `--roisize 10`, which greatly speeds up the generation of the parameter maps.
```
SLIXParameterGenerator -i ./Vervet1818_s0512_60um_SLI_090_Stack_1day.nii -o .
```

##### Average
<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/avg.jpg" width="327">

`_average.tiff` shows the average intensity for each SLI profile (image pixel). Regions with high scattering show higher values.

##### Low Prominence Peaks
<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/low_prominence_peaks.jpg" width="327">

`_low_prominence_peaks.tiff` shows the number of non-prominent peaks for each image pixel, i.e. peaks that have a prominence below 8% of the total signal amplitude (max-min) of the SLI profile and are not used for further evaluation. For a reliable reconstruction of the direction angles, this number should be small, ideally zero.

##### High Prominence Peaks
<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/high_prominence_peaks.jpg" width="327">

`_high_prominence_peaks.tiff` shows the number of prominent peaks for each image pixel, i.e. peaks with a prominence above 8% of the total signal amplitude (max-min) of the SLI profile. The position of these peaks is used to compute the fiber direction angles.

##### Average Peak Prominence
<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/peakprominence.jpg" width="327">

`_peakprominence.tiff` shows the average prominence of the peaks for each image pixel, normalized by the average of each profile. The higher the value, the clearer the signal.

##### Average Peak Width
<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/peakwidth.jpg" width="327">

`_peakwidth.tiff` shows the average width of all prominent peaks for each image pixel. A small peak width implies that the fiber directions can be precisely determined. Larger peak widths occur for out-of-plane fibers and/or fibers with small crossing angles.

##### Peak Distance
<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/peakdistance.jpg" width="327">

`_peakdistance.tiff` shows the distance between two prominent peaks for each image pixel. If an SLI profile contains only one peak, the distance is zero. In regions with crossing nerve fibers, the distance is not defined and the image pixels are set to `-1`. The peak distance is a measure for the out-of-plane angle of the fibers: A peak distance of about 180° implies that the region contains in-plane fibers; the more the fibers point out of the section plane, the smaller the peak distance becomes. For fibers with an inclination angle of about 70° and above, a single broad peak is expected.

##### Direction Angles
The in-plane direction angles are only computed if the SLI profile has one, two, four, or six prominent peaks with a pair-wise distance of (180 +/- 35)°. Otherwise, the image pixel is set to `-1`. The direction angle is computed from the mid position of one peak pair, or (in case of only one peak) from the position of the peak itself. All direction angles are in degrees (with 0° being along the positive x axis, and 90° along the positive y-axis). 

In case of three or five prominent peaks, the peak pairs cannot be safely assigned and are therefore not evaluated. SLI profiles with three peaks could also be caused e.g. by strongly inclined crossing fibers, where a reliable determination of the in-plane fiber directions is not possible. If an SLI profile contains three prominent peaks, it might also be the case that the forth peak lies below the prominence threshold because the signal is not very clear. To account for missing peaks, the user has the possibility to decrease the prominence threshold by setting another value with `--prominence_threshold`. However, this should be done with caution, as this also causes non-significant peaks that are generated by noise or other artifacts to be considered for evaluation and might yield wrong fiber direction angles. Therefore, we strongly recommend to read the derivation in [Menzel et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01037), Appx. A, before adjusting the threshold.

<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/dir_1.jpg" width="327">

`_dir_1.tiff` shows the first detected fiber direction angle. 

<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/dir_2.jpg" width="327">

`_dir_2.tiff` shows the second detected fiber direction angle (only defined in regions with two or three crossing fibers).

<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/dir_3.jpg" width="327">

`_dir_3.tiff` shows the third detected fiber direction angle (only defined in regions with three crossing fibers).

<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/dir.jpg" width="327">

`_dir.tiff` shows the fiber direction angle only in regions with one or two prominent peaks, i.e. excluding regions with crossing fibers.

##### Maximum 
<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/max.jpg" width="327">

`_max.tiff` shows the maximum of the SLI profile for each image pixel. 

##### Minimum
<img src="https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/j.reuter/slix/-/raw/assets/max.jpg" width="327">

`_min.tiff` shows the minimum of the SLI profile for each image pixel. 
To obtain a measure for the signal-to-noise, the difference between maximum and minimum can be divided by the average.

## Tutorial
The [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/3d-pli/SLIX/blob/master/examples/Visualization_Example.ipynb) demonstrates how SLIX can be used to analyze SLI measurements and to visualize the results. For example, it allows to display the generated parameter maps in different colors, and to show the orientations of (crossing) nerve fibers as colored lines (vector maps) by computing unit vector maps from the direction maps. The following vector map has been generated with the function `visualize_unit_vectors`, using `alpha = 0.8` (defining the transparency of the background image), `thinout = 30` (i.e. 30 x 30 pixels were evaluated together), and `background_threshold = 0.7` (i.e. if more than 70% of the evaluated pixels are `-1`, no vector will be computed).

## Performance Metrics
The actual runtime depends on the complexity of the SLI image stack. Especially the number of images in the stack and the number of image pixels can have a big influence. To test the performance, four different SLI image stacks from the coronal vervet brain section (containing 24 images with 2469x3272 pixels each) were analyzed by running the program (generation of all 12 parameter maps with high resolution: `--optional --roisize 1`), using different thread counts and averaging the number of pixels evaluated per second. In total, 32.314.632 line profiles were evaluated for this performance evaluation. All performance measurements were taken without times for reading and writing files.

Our testing system consists of an AMD Ryzen 3700X at 3.60-4.425 GHz paired with 16 GiB DDR4-3000 memory. Other system configurations might take longer or shorter to compute the parameter maps.
